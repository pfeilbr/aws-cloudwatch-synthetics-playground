> You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries, configurable scripts that run on a schedule, to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries follow the same routes and perform the same actions as a customer, which makes it possible for you to continually verify your customer experience even when you don't have any customer traffic on your applications.

* trigger types - cron (1 min smallest freq), run once
* [can run in VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html)
* can also used in any workloads requiring general browser automation
* creates several [CloudWatch metrics in `CloudWatchSynthetics` namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_metrics.html)
* EventBridge support.  See [monitoring canary events with Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitoring-events-eventbridge.html)
